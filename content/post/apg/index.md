“What drives growth in a country” has been an enduring topic in development accounting. Two things are on the top of economists’ heads: for poor countries, K/Y is low and education is low. We will mostly focus on K/Y. 

One strand of literature started with the Lucas Paradox. Lucas presented a paradox in [his 1990 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2006549) that capital does not flow from rich to poor countries even though the estimated MPK seems much higher in poor countries. [Caselli and Feyrer (2007)](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/casellif/papers/mpk.pdf) made two adjustment to this calculation and their results suggest that capital prices and MPKs are actually not very different between rich and poor countries. 

## Sectoral Misallocation and Agricultural Productivity Gap

The other strand discusses the agricultural productivity gap (APG). The discussion centers on what plagues the urban-sector development in poor countries–i.e. a large proportion of population stays within the agricultural sector even if they could be more productive in the urban sector. This is true either when looking at national accounts data or using micro-level data as in [Gollin-Lagakos-Waugh (2014)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19628).

In their estimates, the raw APG is 3.5 and APG after all adjustments is 2.2. This deviates it from 1 as we would expect in a frictionless setting–i.e. labor will go to whichever sector that offers higher return. 

Followup literature suggested that there are frictions involved with workers going from one sector to another. For example, education and skills[^1], social bonds[^2], etc. And more studies have focused on using quasi-experimental evidence. For example, [Nakamura-Sigurdsson-Steinsson (2021)](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~enakamura/papers/giftofmoving.pdf) paper shows that people induced to move from high income village due to volcanic eruption saw large increase in income, but they are not willing to do so since there is a “fixed” moving cost. (This is somewhat akin to the literature on price adjustment with a menu cost model in that people are not willing to adjust price until the costs of a suboptimal price overcome the fixed menu cost).

## A Two-Step Process

The classic view is that development is about reallocation out of agriculture into “modern” sectors[^3]. As discussed above, this involves mobility between the agricultural sector and the urban sectors. An angle to look at the Chinese growth miracle is exactly that.

China adopted this [three-sector accounting model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model), where the primary sector is mostly agricultural sector, the secondary sector is the manufacturing and industrial sector, and the tertiary sector is the service sector. We can see from the breakdown that while the size of agriculture diminished significantly, industry more or less reached its current level at the beginning of the opening period. Most of the growth in the post-liberalization period (post-1978) has been in services, which has gone hand in hand with the urbanization process.[^4]

[^4]: Note that the sharp increase in the secondary sector share could be a result from the decline in the primary sector, since they need to add up to 100%. But if the decline in the primary sector were the sole driver of this movement, we would also see a big increase in the tertiary sector, which is not really the case here. This suggests that at least some fraction of this big increase in the secondary sector is real. 

There can be multiple ways to explain how China attained a high level of growth in the industrial sector in the 50s and continued in the 60s. First, the data is flawed and there are huge mismeasurements. There is a collection of literature that discusses this. Second, if we believe the data is telling the truth–the structural transformation was already starting to take place before either opening up or the Household Responsibility System (HRS)[^5]–then we may want to give some credit to the central planning that took place in the 50s and 60s.

## The Five-Year Plan

[The Five-Year Plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China) are a series of social and economic development initiatives issued by the Chinese Communist Party since 1953 in the People's Republic of China.

After reestablishing a functioning economic base, China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, pursued a socialist transformation heavily influenced by Soviet methods. China's First Five-Year Plan prioritized industrial development, creating them from scratch. Government intervention increased control over industry, with private modern enterprises either sold to the state or transformed into joint public-private enterprises. Despite strains on agricultural production, the plan proved successful. “During this Plan period, China began developing a heavy-industrial base and brought its industrial production above what it had been prior to war. China also raised its agricultural production to above prewar levels, resulting primarily from gains in efficiency brought about by the reorganization and cooperation achieved through cooperative farming. Although urbanization had not been a specific goal of the plan's focus on industrialization, industrialization also prompted extensive urban growth. By 1956, China had completed its socialist transformation of the domestic economy.”[^6]

## A Two-Step Process

Based on the discussions above, I propose that the structural transformation from an agricultural state into an industrial one that happened in China is a two-step process. The first step involves a relatively “authoritarian” approach to stimulate growth in the industrial sector, whereas both labor and technology are required in the process. The second step centers around the liberalization of markets, which unleashes the power of the “invisible hand”. 

While most of our focus has been on the second step that brings about a good institution, the first step should not be ignored. The goal of the first step is to overcome the “fixed cost” to achieve labor and capital mobility in the early industrialization phase. 

To do this, either one of the two needs to be satisfied:
Endogenous: A boost in efficiency in the industrial sector to allow the industrial sector to overcome the initial fixed cost to move in both labor and capital. 
Exogenous: Laws or rulings by a state, wars or conflicts, colonization, etc. that makes capital and labor flow to the industrial sector (even if it’s not necessary Pareto-efficient)

The structural transformation in China in the 1950s and 60s seem to fall into the second category. And the United Kingdom seems to be a fixture of both: on one hand, the Industrial Revolution was underway; on the other hand, the [enclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure) drove surplus peasant labor from their farms to the towns to become industrial workers. It is considered by some scholars to be the beginnings of the emergence of capitalism.

## Research Approach: Variation and Identification

The sources of variation that we can explore about Chinese growth are very limited. Causally-identified empirical work is unusually scarce, partly because of the lack of reliable, disaggregated official data, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. 

However, one data source offers some promises. During the Cold War, the CIA's CORONA (1960-72) and Keyhole-9 (1972-83) spy satellites collected thousands of high-resolution, black-and-white daytime images from almost the entire land surface of the Earth[^7]. With remote sensing data, we can build a deep learning pipeline (such as [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) for object detection) that identifies and distinguishes land used for agricultural and industrial purposes. 

We can find variation in how different towns and villages pushed the First Five-Year Plan of industrialization and explore how it contributed to the later-on economic growth.
