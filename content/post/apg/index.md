“What drives growth in a country” has been an enduring topic in development accounting. Two things are on the top of economists’ heads: for poor countries, K/Y is low and education is low. We will mostly focus on K/Y. 

One strand of literature started with the Lucas Paradox. Lucas presented a paradox in [his 1990 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2006549) that capital does not flow from rich to poor countries even though the estimated MPK seems much higher in poor countries. [Caselli and Feyrer (2007)](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/casellif/papers/mpk.pdf) made two adjustment to this calculation and their results suggest that capital prices and MPKs are actually not very different between rich and poor countries. 

## Sectoral Misallocation and Agricultural Productivity Gap

The other strand discusses the agricultural productivity gap (APG). The discussion centers on what plagues the urban-sector development in poor countries–i.e. a large proportion of population stays within the agricultural sector even if they could be more productive in the urban sector. This is true either when looking at national accounts data or using micro-level data as in [Gollin-Lagakos-Waugh (2014)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19628).

In their estimates, the raw APG is 3.5 and APG after all adjustments is 2.2. This deviates it from 1 as we would expect in a frictionless setting–i.e. labor will go to whichever sector that offers higher return. 

Followup literature suggested that there are frictions involved with workers going from one sector to another. For example, education and skills[^1], social bonds[^2], etc. And more studies have focused on using quasi-experimental evidence. For example, [Nakamura-Sigurdsson-Steinsson (2021)](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~enakamura/papers/giftofmoving.pdf) paper shows that people induced to move from high income village due to volcanic eruption saw large increase in income, but they are not willing to do so since there is a “fixed” moving cost. (This is somewhat akin to the literature on price adjustment with a menu cost model in that people are not willing to adjust price until the costs of a suboptimal price overcome the fixed menu cost).

## A Two-Step Process

The classic view is that development is about reallocation out of agriculture into “modern” sectors[^3]. As discussed above, this involves mobility between the agricultural sector and the urban sectors. An angle to look at the Chinese growth miracle is exactly that.

China adopted this [three-sector accounting model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model), where the primary sector is mostly agricultural sector, the secondary sector is the manufacturing and industrial sector, and the tertiary sector is the service sector. We can see from the breakdown that while the size of agriculture diminished significantly, industry more or less reached its current level at the beginning of the opening period. Most of the growth in the post-liberalization period (post-1978) has been in services, which has gone hand in hand with the urbanization process.
