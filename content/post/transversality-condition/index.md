In Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model, the transversality condition is usually imposed to rule out a series of dynamic paths. The transversality condition requires the present value of the state variables to converge to zero as the planning horizon recedes towards infinity. The intuition, as Robert Barro and Xavier Sala-i-Martin explained in their textbook _Economic Growth_, is that "optimizing agents do not want to have any valuable assets left over at the end" and that "it would be suboptimal for
households to accumulate positive assets forever at the rate {{< math >}}$r${{< /math >}} or higher, because utility would increase if these assets were instead consumed in finite time. " ([p.92](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Economic_Growth_second_edition/4KnuDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA92&printsec=frontcover))

However, there are many literature that argue the transversality condition is built on rather shaky mathematical grounds. But this is not the focus for us. 

If we focus on the macroeconomy, the transversality condition implies that the growth rate of capital stock has to be lower than the real interest rate. 

Note that this also happens when considering the growth miracles. For growth miracles, the growth of output consistently exceeds the real rate of interest for several decades as was the case for Japan between 1960 and 1990 or China between 1990 and 2010.
