If the Federal Reserve did a good job anchoring the inflation expectation, then it is natural to assume that the market forecast of both the federal funds rate and the inflation rate would (at least roughly) align with those made by the Federal Reserve board. But it seems like this assumption comes with some caveats. 

In the chart above, the red line is the average market yield for long-term TIPS. And the blue line is the difference between the projected federal funds rate and the projected inflation--both from the [Summary of Economic Projects](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide-to-the-summary-of-economic-projections.htm). Inherently, both should represent the long-run real interest rate in the economy (they wouldn't match exactly though since TIPS is based on CPI while SEP is projected PCE). 

One can easily observe a clear divergence of these two measures starting around the COVID pandemic.
