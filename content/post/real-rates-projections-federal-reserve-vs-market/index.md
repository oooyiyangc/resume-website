If the Federal Reserve does a good job of forward guidance, then it is natural to assume that the market's forecast of both the federal funds rate and the inflation rate would be (at least roughly) in line with the Federal Reserve Board's forecast. However it seems that this assumption comes with some caveats. 

In the chart above, the red line is the average market yield on long-term TIPS. And the blue line is the difference between the median projected federal funds rate and the median projected inflation--both from [the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide-to-the-summary-of-economic-projections.htm). Inherently, both should represent the long-run real interest rate in the economy (they wouldn't match exactly though since TIPS is based on CPI while SEP is projecting PCE). 

It is easy to see that these two measures began to diverge around the COVID pandemic.

On the other hand, inflation expectation seems to be well-anchored as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate continues to stay close to 2\%. In this case, the high yield rates for TIPS may imply that the market is expecting the Fed to hold the rates high for an extended period of time (perhaps even longer than those who sit in the FOMC meetings are expecting).
